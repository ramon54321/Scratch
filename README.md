## Scratch
A simple web scratch pad. My lab of experiments. Most go horribly wrong.

### Fish Ecosystem
A WebGL based ecosystem simulation. This is a speed programming experiment, where I program whenever I can, however, when I do, I ensure to program with speed in mind, not structure. This results in hacking ugly code together.
This might seem like bad practice, and in general it is, however, there is a place and time for ugly quick code, and that is when you are rapid prototyping and experimenting with ideas, which is exactly what this is.
